note over browser:
the whole sequence starts, when user submits a new note
using submit-button (AS HTTP POST operation)
end note

note over browser:
when user submits the note, the note is first added on the
browsers user-side page, and afterwards sent to the server
without reloading the page
risk: if HTTP POST fails, server side database is not updated even though UI shows updated version?
end note

browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note
server->browser: HTTP-SUCCESS

note over browser:
unlike previously, new data is not requested
